# 🇹🇷 Turkey Earthquake Map - Historical Analysis (2000-2024) 🌍

This project presents a comprehensive analysis and visualization of approximately 1000 earthquake events in Turkey between the years 2000 and 2024. Using Python along with Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries, the dataset is explored through various visual representations to understand temporal, spatial, and magnitude-related characteristics of seismic activity.

## ✨ Features

- 📈 Time series analysis showing the annual count of earthquakes  
- 📊 Histogram of earthquake magnitudes distribution  
- 📍 Scatter plot of earthquake locations across Turkey on a map  
- 🔵 Bubble chart depicting total earthquake count and average magnitude by city  
- ⚖️ Scatter plot illustrating the relationship between earthquake depth and magnitude  
- 🌡️ Heatmap representing earthquake density and hotspot regions  
- 🎞️ Animated visualization showing yearly changes in earthquake distribution  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- 🐍 Python 3  
- 🗃️ Pandas for data manipulation  
- 📉 Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization  
- 📓 Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis  

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. 📥 Download the `depremler.csv` dataset included in the repository.  
2. 🖥️ Open the Jupyter Notebook and load the dataset using Pandas.  
3. ▶️ Execute the code cells step-by-step to generate the visualizations.  
4. 🔎 Explore the detailed seismic activity insights for Turkey over 24 years.  

## 🎯 Purpose

This project aims to deepen skills in data visualization and provide insightful analysis of seismic patterns in Turkey, helping to better understand earthquake frequency, severity, and geographical distribution.
